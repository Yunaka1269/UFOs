# UFOs

##Dana would like to provide more filtering items that allow user to search with multiple criteria on her UFO sightings webpage. 

###Resources

- image:	nasa.jpg

- Software: 	
		Visual Studio Code 1.51.1
		
##Results:

The user may input search criteria in one or more ***[tables](https://github.com/Yunaka1269/UFOs/blob/main/ufo.PNG)*** to filter UFO sightings data. After entering keyword (in all lower case), press enter to get the data filtered. Please note that this page doesn't allow user to enter multiple search boxes at once so the user is required to press enter after each input. This applies for clearing the input box too. The user is required to delete the keyword in box and press enter to remove the filter.

##Summary

- Drawback:

The drawback of this webpage is that the user must write the exact match of spelling, upper/lower case, and date format to successfully return the filtered data. Otherwise, the webpage will show the blank page without displaying any error message.

- Recommendations:

The webpage can be improved by followings:

1. add dropdown list and checkbox function in search criteria box instead of user input to avoid typo.

2. add sort by function

3. enable the user to export data to excel and or csv

4. add link so that the user can click and jump to the artcle about each UFO sightings
